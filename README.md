*** Yes, there's a good bit of theater here, and we like it. More importantly, all these interior bits are crafted to look and function in a far more upscale way than any Corvette of the past. The only odd bit to this interior is the look of that sweeping line of buttons separating the driver from passenger. It's a little strange but functions well. The Vette has plenty of space for two people to find comfort. The nearly 13-cubic-foot trunk is about what you'd find in a compact sedan — plenty of space for two people to pack heavy. The Porsche 911 provides slightly more room for people and stuff due to its small backseat.

***Infotainment and Connectivity
Every Corvette comes standard with Chevrolet's 8-inch infotainment touchscreen. It's equipped with Bluetooth audio streaming and voice recognition and serves up cloud-connected personalization for vehicle and app settings. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, too. The system works well but seems a bit dated when other automakers are offering larger touchscreens. However, this type of tech tends to lag in the high-end sports-car world. And compared to other sports cars, the Corvette's system is actually quite intuitive.

***Safety
The Chevrolet Corvette hasn't been tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).
